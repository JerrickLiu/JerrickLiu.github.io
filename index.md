## Hello! My name is Jerrick Liu

I'm currently studying computer science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I'm also working with the Air Force Research Laboratory doing some cool stuff with computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Head over to my [projects](projects/projects.html) and my [work experience](work.md) pages to see what I've done!

### Some of my loves

- I love golf.
- I love ping-pong.
- I love noodles.
