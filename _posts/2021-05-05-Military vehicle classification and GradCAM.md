Through using supervised learning, I was able to train CNNs to classify 18
                                        different classes of military vehicles.
                                        I also used GradCAM, an explainable AI
                                        technique used to visualize where the
                                        CNN is looking at in an image. To the
                                        left, I ran the GradCAM code on an image
                                        of myself! Pretty cool!
